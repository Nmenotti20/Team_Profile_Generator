### Project Description

This project's pupose is to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then some useful information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members from engineers to interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a team roster based on the user input.

#### User Story

I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

### Installation

Navigate to the "Develop" Directory and from the terminal run "node app.js" to start the question sequence.  Follow the questions and submit answers by hitting enter. You may add as many members to the team roster as you like. To view the roster output, navigate to the "output" directory and open the team.html file in the browser.  You should see the team you have built populated on the team.html page in an easy to view format.

The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

The project must generate a team.html page in the output directory, that displays a team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

*Name

*Role

*ID

*Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)
